
# ðŸŽ® NFT FPS Shooter Blockchain Game 

This project is a replica from the FPS game that was presented on the [Build Web3 Unity Game | NFT FPS Shooter Blockchain Game using Moralis, Unity, C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBmaji1E2LY) youtube video.  

The goal was to teach how to use Moralis Unity SDK.

In this game, the player connects a Metamask/Trust Wallet by scanning a QR Code with his/her mobile device.  
Then, after defeating the boss, the player can claim an NFT on Mumbai Testnet.

## Testing

To test this project, clone this repository and open it with Unity.  

I was no able to create an WebGL version due to Moralis Unity SDK limitations.
